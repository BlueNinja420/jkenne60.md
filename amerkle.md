Major: Computer Science (Non-Degree)

# Background
I acquired my Bachelor's Degree in 2017 and have been working in education since then. I have spent three years working in higher education student services, with the last two being here at the University of Tennessee, and another two teaching English in Japan. My Bachelor's Degree was in International Studies, and this semester will fill out my second year taking pre-requisite courses to get started on an MS in Computer Science.

# Interests
I have a wide array of interests, and I try to balance them so as to round out my ability to speak at parties. They include: 
* Gaming
* Gardening
* Exercise
* Professional sports
* Volunteering
* Solving practical problems

# Languages
Java (introductory semester, COSC-101)
Python (COSC-111 and COSC-370)
CPP (COSC-102, COSC-202, COSC-302, COSC-311)
CSS (COSC-302 project)
Assembly (COSC-230)
I also speak English, and some Japanese. I don't know if that matters to y'all, but I think it's kinda neat.
