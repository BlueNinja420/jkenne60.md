## Background
I was born in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the place that enriched the uranium for the Manhattan project. My family and I moved to Knoxville about eleven years ago and we've been living here ever since.

I got into modding about eight years ago and soon fell in love with making entirely new mechanics for games. It has gotten to the point where I mod videogames more than I actually play them. From there, I realized that learning how to program in an actual programming language instead of using what the game developers grant modders (although the tools for the games I mod are fairly powerful) was probably the best move, and so far I have found learning how to program intuitive and easy.

## Interests
I am interested in the following:
- Programming
- [Modding Video Games](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Modding/)
- Playing Video Games
- History
- Warfare
- Geography
- Technology
- Economics
- Geopolitics
- Philosophy/Theology
- Reading
- Learning in general

What *really* catches my interest is often when two or more of these interact. For example, how much of the impetus for the [Scramble for Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_for_Africa/) (History) was inspired by the fact that other great powers of the period were also going into Africa (Geopolitics) which was only possible with the discovery of quinine's anti-malarial properties (Technology) along with the invention of the gatling gun that allowed the subduing of the native African kingdoms and empires (Warfare). Not to mention that the steam engine allowed small river boats to completely navigate African rivers and project power from them (Technology, Warfare, Geopoltics, and Geography).

*Everything* is connected, and I love learning how and why.

## Familiarity
I'm familiar with a fair few programs and programming languages. These are listed in order of familiarity (from most to least familiar).

Languages: C++, Java, C#, Javascript, Python
Tools: VSCode, Git, Unity, Vim, Pygame, Make
