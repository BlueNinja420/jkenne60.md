# Background

My background is actually heavily founded in the arts. I only pivoted into computer science in
my junior year of high school, so I had to play a bit of catch-up my freshman year of
college, but it was worth it.

# Interests

In terms of computer science, I have an interest in software development as a career trajectory, but I'm undecided.
For abstract concepts, though, I love machine learning, specifically in language processing. I also
have an interest in quantum computing, even though most of it goes over my head currently.

Outside of computer science, here are some of my hobbies:

- digital art
- crochet
- writing
- linguistics
