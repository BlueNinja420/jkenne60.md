Hey, I'm Connor! I'm a junior in CS from Nashville. I started programming in high school and have been taking programming/computer science classes ever since. I've had the privilege of working as a software engineer at a couple tech companies and gained insight to the software development processes at both the medium and large scale. I also serve as the Control Systems Lead for Tennessee Lunabotics.

Outside of computers, I enjoy music (I play guitar and percussion instruments), rock climbing, hiking & camping, water sports, snow sports, and soccer.

Languages, Frameworks, and Tools I'm familiar with:
- C/C++/X++
- Java
- Javascript
- Python
- HTML/CSS
- Vue
- Django
- SQL
- Git
- UE5
- Dynamics/D365/DaX
