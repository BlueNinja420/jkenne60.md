## Intrests and background:

My name is Colin Lyttle,
I'm a Senior at the University of Tennessee, working towards my bachelor's in Computer Science.
I've chosen to major in Computer Science as I enjoy finding and creating solutions to technical challenges.
When I program, I look at programming challenges as a puzzle with multiple possible solutions.
By approaching programming this way I find great enjoyment in creating the best possible solution I can
for a programming challenge.
The programing languages I have the most experience working with C,C++, and python.
I'm also familiar with the basics of Java, Javascript, and C#.
Some interests of mine include backpacking, mountain biking, cars, and music.
