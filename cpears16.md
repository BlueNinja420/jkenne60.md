## Background
I've always enjoyed playing games, and it's what led me into computer science. I got my start with coding a few years back when I decided to try out game development as a hobby. I decided to learn Lua since it was the coding language for the engine I intended to use, and I found that I really enjoyed coding. From there I started taking classes and learning more languages, such as Java, JavaScript, Python, and C++, as well as a few engines. With that experience I decided to major in computer science, as I expected it would likely be the best fit for me.
