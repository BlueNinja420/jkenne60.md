Major: Computer Science

## Background

I am from Maryville, TN, but I also came from a Vietnamese background. I was uncertain of the path I would take before coming to UT, but I eventually chose Computer Science since that field had a high surge of demands. The journey to this field has been challenging since I never really coded besides Scratch back when I was in middle school, but these challenges opened my eyes that are more than just assignments I have to complete. These have helped me extend my problem-solving skills I wish I had dived further back in middle and high school, as well as realizing how flexible coding can accomplish, especially in the medical, science, and even art fields.
