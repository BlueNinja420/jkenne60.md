## General Info

Hi there! My name is Gabe, and I'm from Knoxville, TN. I went to Bearden High School, where I an actor in the theatre department, and at the time I was more interested in acting than programming!

Currently, some of my main interests include cars, video games, PC building, playing guitar and bass, and going to metal concerts (and listening to metal music, of course). If you'd like to listen to one of my favorite songs, click [here](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=MZFdeIDzChSeFCvQ)!
