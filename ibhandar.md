# All About Me!
My name is Isha, and I am a junior majoring in computer science. My netid is ibhandar, and my GitHub username is Isha-B-GitHub

## Background
My family is from India, and I was the first person to be born in the United States. I grew up primarily in East Tennessee and became interested in coding in high school, when I took AP Computer Science Principles. In college, I am very passionate about the Society of Women Engineers organzation and making a positive impact in the lives of others.

## Interests
I tend to change my interests quite a bit! My current ones include music and specifically going to concerts, travelling and walking around new cities, scrapbooking all of my college memories, and volunteering with organizations that I am passionate about. 

One organization I am passionate about volunteering with is Big Brothers Big Sisters of East Tennessee. If you are interested in becoming a mentor at this amazing organization, I would highly recommend [applying to become a Big at this link](https://tennesseebig.org/get-involved/).

This summer, I have also become interested in research relating to Human-Computer Interaction!

## Computer Frameworks
The following include computer frameworks that I have had experience with:
* C++
* Java
* Kotlin

I also know the basics of the Python language. I am always willing and excited to learn other languages and frameworks!
