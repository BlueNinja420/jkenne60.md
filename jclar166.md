##Jonathan Clark, jclar166, JonClark28, Computer Science

##Background
I was born in Knoxville and am the youngest of three brothers. My oldest brother majored in Pscyhology at UTK and my older brother majored in Nuclear Engineering, also at
UTK. I became interested in Computer Science in high school when looking through mods for games such as Skyrim and Minecraft. I took my first coding course in my sophomore
year of high school, where we learned Java and HTML.

##Interests
I love video games, specifically story driven RPGs like **Baldur's Gate 3** and the **The Life and Suffering of Sir Brante** series. I play table top games such as **D&D** with my friends on a semi-regular
basis. I love metal music and all of its subgenres, and my favorite band is Powerwolf. I love comic books and sci-fi/adventure stories. [Once and Future](https://www.boom-studios.com/series/oncefuture/)
deserves much more attention than it gets. **Dune** and **Lord of the Rings** are tied
for my favoriute series of all time.
