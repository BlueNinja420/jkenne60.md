# Jordan Huff Mini-Resume

## Info:
- **NetID:** jhuff19
- **GitHub Username:** jordantrh
- **Major:** Industrial and Systems Engineering

## Background:
I'm a senior in ISE and will be graduating in December, and have been taking CS coursework for all of my electives due to my interest in data science and machine learning. I've been participating in machine learning research with the ISE department since freshman year and was actually published this past spring [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10137869/). I've done several internships and co-ops, and just finished a data science internship with Bridgestone in Nashville this past summer.

## Hobbies and Interests:
Outside of school and career development, I'm a big music head, especially for funk, R&B, and rap. Stevie Wonder is awesome, Anderson .Paak is great, early Jamiroquai is really cool, and I've also been getting into this band called Haitus Kaiyote recently, especially their [latest album](https://hiatuskaiyote.com/). I also have been getting back into reading a ton this past year. The "Game of Thrones" books are great and I've been reading "All the King's Men" recently too. Love it.
