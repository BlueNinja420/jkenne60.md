### Info

### Background
I am from Knoxville, and started CS due to my interest in math and logic puzzles. Since then, I have had several software development jobs in web application development. I love backend programming, specifically database structure design and data manipulation. However, I am looking towards doing more projects that are heavier on math, such as developing a game engine or a neural net.
