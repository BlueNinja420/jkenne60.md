## Background ##
I have completed through CS302 (Data Structures and Algorithms II) at UT. Over Summer 2023, I had the privilege of interning as a student software developer at the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) for the Power Quality program. I gained valuable understandings of full-stack development and process automation. 

## Academic Interests ##
I am extremely interested in embedded systems and robotics. I want to apply microprocess solutions to either the automobile industry, the ship/submarine industry, or the translation industry. 

## Personal Interests ##
I like to be as involved as possible in my environment so that I can reap the most opportunity. My current involvements at UT include:
- Recruitment Chair for the UT Womens' Rugby Club (I play as a Lock)
- Vice President of the UT German Club
- Electrical Point of Contact (Formerly known as Electrical Lead) for the Tennessee Lunabotics 

## Familiar Languages/Tools ##

## Hyperlink ##
I wasn't sure what to use for my HTML page, so I decided to include a project I completed for my Germ423 (Films in Berlin) course from last semester. I would not use the HTML/CSS/Javascript combo again now that I am more familiar with Frameworks.
