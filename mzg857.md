## Background
#### I'm a computer science student interested in machine learning and data science. This summer I worked at NIMBioS, an on-campus lab, researching ways to integrate ChatGPT into a data collection pipeline.
## Interests
#### I really love music and hanging out with my friends. I've been trying to learn how to play the piano, but I'm not very good at it :)
#### Last week I went on a hike to [Abrams Falls](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/abrams-falls.htm). It's a two and a half mile hike from the Cades Cove Loop. It was really fun!

## Computer languages, tools, and frameworks I use
#### I'm proficient in C++, Python, and SQL. This summer, I gained a lot of experience in several Python libraries, like Pandas, Matplotlib, Geopy, Openai, and Pytesseract
