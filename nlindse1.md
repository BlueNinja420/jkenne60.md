# Nicholas Lindsey

Hello! My name is Nicholas Lindsey. I prefer to be called Nick. 

- **netid:** nlindse1
- **GitHub:** nryanl
- **Major:** Computer Science

## Background
I'm a 24-year-old student and also a Knoxville native. I changed majors several times: I started in I.T., switched to Chemistry, and now I have come full circle to the engineering college studying Computer Science.

## Interests
I love building things and I love playing video games. Over the summer, I've been working on a Discord bot. As for video games, I do not play as much as I used to, but I did play [League of Legends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends) competitively for 7 years, and I play a wide variety of other games as well.
I also enjoy going to Hockey games. If you haven't checked out the local team, The [Knoxville Ice Bears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knoxville_Ice_Bears), which plays at the Knoxville Civic Coliseum, then you should!
I am an avid Linux user. If you have questions, you can ask!
