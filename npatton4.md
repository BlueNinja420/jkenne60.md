1. Major: Computer Science

## Background
Hi, I'm Nolan! I'm from the Nashville area.
I've been interested in computer science for my entire life.
I took classes and extracirriculars related to coding and digital media whenever possible in elementary school and middle school.
In high school I took AP Computer Science, three electives with Python coding, and a year-long computer science independent study.
When it was time to pick a major, I knew almost right away that I wanted to go into computer science.

I'm especially excited for this class because software engineering is what I really want to do with my degree. :)

## Interests
My main interest is video games and video game development; it's the reason I'm studying computer science. I love all aspects of game development, from coding to game design to art and music.

Outside of computers, I like writing, music, movies, and YouTube. I'm also a theme park enthusiast.

Here's a link to [my games page](https://stev51.itch.io/) with the three tiny games I've published so far. It's unimpressive but I'm still proud. :)

## Experience
* Most of my coding experience has been with Python (my three games are 100% Python)
* I'm also decent with C++ after four semesters at UT
* I had two semesters with Java and two semesters with JavaScript in high school
* I've slightly dabbled in HTML and Assembly
* I used Git and GitHub for the first time earlier this year when collaborating on a game, so I have minimal experience with the basics
* I'm in the process of learning Unity (using C++ as the scripting language) for the first time, and I have a bit of experience with RPG Maker (which uses JavaScript)
