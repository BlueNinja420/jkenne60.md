## About Me
---
My name is Peyton Davis. I'm a 5th-year senior majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I competed on the track and field team as a decathlete for four years. I grew up in Centralia, Missouri, and came to Knoxville back in 2019 to join the track team.

Some of my interests outside of track include rock climbing, disc golf, building lego sets, and watching anime. I'm still training and I work part-time, so all those hobbies are thrown in when I have time.

Here is a link to my track page:
