## About Me:

**Major**: Computer Science, Art (Minor)  

Hello! My name is Reagan Sanz. I am currently a Junior, and this is my second semester in UTK's computer science
program (Pellissiippi Transfer). I enjoy watching marvel movies, reading books, and drinking coffee.  

I'm hoping to pursue hobbies/careers that combine both my programming/engineering skills and 
my artistic abilities. Whether it's a pencil on paper or code on a screen, I simply love to **create**.  


**My Favorites**:  
* Favorite Movie: Guardians of the Galaxy  
* Favorite Shows: Moonknight, Good Omens, the Mandalorian  
* Favorite Book: Cemetery Boys  
* Favorite Song: "This Side of Paradise" by Coyote Theory
