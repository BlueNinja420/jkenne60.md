Hello! My name is Sam Craddock and Im currently majoring in Computer Science
and minoring in Japanese. My dream job is to program videogames, specifically
for FromSoftware, although these are both long term goals of mine that I do
not really expect to achieve for quite some time. My main hobbies are cosplay,
videogames, and Dungeon and Dragons.

Videogames and their design philosophies are something I like to casually study!
Some of my favorites have been:
1. [Inscryption] (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1092790/Inscryption/)
2. [Dark Souls] (https://store.steampowered.com/app/570940/DARK_SOULS_REMASTERED/)
3. [Silent Hill 2] (https://enhanced.townofsilenthill.com/SH2/)
4. [Metal Gear Solid] (https://www.gog.com/en/game/metal_gear_solid)

Some of the CS languages and tools I enjoy are
* C++
* Python
* Java
* Unity
* Unreal Engine
