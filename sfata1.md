## Interests and Background
Some of my interests and hobbies include traveling, reading, and scrapbooking I find that these things are often therapeutic and enjoyable to do.
A little bit of background of why I chose computer science is in my freshman year of high school I took an intro to technology class where I learned scratch, html, css, binary code, and hexadecimal. After taking that class I decided I want to pursue a career in computer science.
