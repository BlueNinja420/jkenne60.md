## About Me
Hello, my name is Skye, this is my 3rd year at UTK, and I am from Elizabethton, Tennessee. I enjoy arts and crafts, animals (especially my pets), the internet, video games, robots, arcade rhythm games, and, of course, computers.

[Here](https://remywiki.com/Main_Page) is a link to a wiki about some of the arcade rhythm games I enjoy. If you like reading Wikipedia articles in your free time, these wikis might give you some more reading material.
