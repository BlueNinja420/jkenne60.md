 Hello, I am a Computer Engineering major at UTK and in my final year of college. I transferred to UTK from Pellissippi State Community College with an associates in science in Computer Science and decided to do Computer Engineering over Computer Science. Programming was one of my hobbies throughout middle school and high school which was the largest factor for me choosing this career path. Java was the first programming language I learned was the only programming language I was proficient in until the last year of high school when I started experimenting with C++.

As stated, programming was one of my interests, however my interest in it has wavered since entering college and don't consider it a hobby any more. When I started coming to UTK I found the UT Amateur Radio Club and have been active in that club for two years and even became it's president. Since I've become and amateur radio operator (or a HAM as some others would say) I've contacted 54 different countries and have contacted all 50 states in the United States and even contacted every continent at least once, all on only 100 watts of power from my radio and no relay points or other infrastructure, just me and the other station I contacted and nothing else. These accomplishments can be viewed on my [QRZ page](https://www.qrz.com/db/KY4NW) (its like facebook for ham radio operators with less privacy invasion).

Another one of my hobbies is playing piano with the ultimate goal of switching to a pipe organ when I have the ability to do so. I'm primarily interested in doing covers for various songs rather than playing the kind of music that you'd expect someone to play on a church organ.

My top four favorite covers played on the organ are:
1. [Davy Jones' theme from Pirates of the Caribbean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PPaAWSLZk0)
2. [Nothing else matters by Metallica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEJ8-nTj8Ws)
3. [The Phantom of the Opera Overture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kulRSW8Ljo)
4. [Africa by Toto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQtoIm4hvn4)

## Skills

I have various skills in computer science ranging from network configuration to programming. Some of the programming languages I've worked with before are:
* Java
* C++
* C
* PHP
* Javascript

As the last two computer languages may suggest, I've worked with Apache2 and MySQL and still maintain a [website](https://ky4nw.com/) which mostly serves as a personal cloud storage and data backup location but this has given me some experiance with HTML and CSS. This website is hosted on my own internet connection and has given me some experiance with network configuration as well as setting up private key authentication for SSH so that only those who have the private key can log in to my server.

The tools I use to manage my server are:
* PuTTY
* MySQL Workbench
* FileZilla
* WeBuilder 2020

When I use programming languages like C or C++, I prefer to make the majority of the program on windows as that is my primary operating system but if something gets too specific to linux I will continue programming on my linux server through SSH. The IDE I use for C and C++ usually is CodeBlocks but I will sometimes use Eclipes which I also sometimes use for programming in Java but I much prefer NetBeans for programming in Java because of it's drag-and-drop UI builder feature. Lastly, any programming done in PHP or Javascript is handled in WeBuilder 2020.
