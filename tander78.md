###Backround/Interests
I was born in Knoxville but I grew up in Franklin, TN (south of Nashville). I decided to pursue a degree in computer science because it seemed like the most relevant engineering degree, and I always found advancements in the tech space pretty interesting. My hobbies include fishing, golf, poker, traveling, lifting, and reading. 

I work as a research assistant for a lab in Min-Kao called [CURENT](https://curent.utk.edu/).
