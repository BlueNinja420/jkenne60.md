- preferred name: Frank
- netid: zfu7
- github username: CelestialTrace
- major: Computer Science


## I was born and raised in China. It during middle school when my family immigrated to the US and spent all of the time here in Tennessee. I was part of the ROTC program and did a bit of track in high school. It was during senior year of high when I took an web design class, which stood out to me from all the rest curriculum in school. It's what led to me choosing computer science as my major.

## outside of school I mostly enjoy gaming, watching and listening to music on youtube.

## language experience: c++, some python
